✨ Features
- Riverpod: State management for scalable and reactive UI.
- GetIt: Dependency injection for decoupled architecture.
- Dio: HTTP client with robust request/response handling.
- Retrofit: API generation for type-safe RESTful calls.
- Floor: Local database using SQLite.
  
Clean Architecture: Separation of concerns for maintainability.

🚀 Getting Started


Prerequisites

Flutter SDK: Install here

Dart SDK

Android Studio or VS Code

Installation

Clone the repository:

```plaintext
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
```

Install dependencies:

```plaintext
flutter pub get
```

Run code generation for Retrofit and Riverpod:

flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```
Start the app:
```plaintext
flutter run
```
🛠️ Core Concepts


Dependency Injection

Managed via GetIt.

Centralized in lib/core/di.dart.

State Management

Built with Riverpod.

ViewModels are annotated with @riverpod and use Provider for reactive updates.
Networking

Powered by Dio and Retrofit for API handling.

Interceptors for logging, headers, and error handling.

Local Database

Built with Floor for offline persistence.

🔑 Example Usage


Fetching User Data


Repository implementation with remote and local data sources:

```dart
class UserRepositoryImpl implements UserRepository {
  final UserRemoteDataSource remoteDataSource;
  final UserLocalDataSource localDataSource;

  UserRepositoryImpl({
    required this.remoteDataSource,
    required this.localDataSource,
  });

  @override
  Future<UserModel> getUser() async {
    final localUser = await localDataSource.getUser(1);
    if (localUser != null) {
      return localUser;
    }
    final remoteUser = await remoteDataSource.getUser();
    await localDataSource.saveUser(remoteUser);
    return remoteUser;
  }
}
```

### Key Updates:
- Fixed the structure for clarity and consistency.
- Added the necessary markdown elements for a more readable format.
- Ensured proper emoji usage for better visual appeal.
