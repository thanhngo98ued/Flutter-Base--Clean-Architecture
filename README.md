✨ Features
Riverpod: State management for scalable and reactive UI.
GetIt: Dependency injection for decoupled architecture.
Dio: HTTP client with robust request/response handling.
Retrofit: API generation for type-safe RESTful calls.
Floor: Local database using SQLite.
Clean Architecture: Separation of concerns for maintainability.

🚀 Getting Started
Prerequisites
Flutter SDK: Install here
Dart SDK
Android Studio or VS Code
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
flutter pub get
Run code generation for Retrofit and Riverpod:

bash
Copy code
flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
Start the app:

bash
Copy code
flutter run
🛠️ Core Concepts
Dependency Injection
Managed via GetIt.
Centralized in lib/core/di.dart.
State Management
Built with Riverpod.
ViewModels are annotated with @riverpod and use Provider for reactive updates.
Networking
Powered by Dio and Retrofit for API handling.
Interceptors for logging, headers, and error handling.
Local Database
Built with Floor for offline persistence.
🔑 Example Usage
Fetching User Data
Repository implementation with remote and local data sources:
dart
Copy code
class UserRepositoryImpl implements UserRepository {
  final UserRemoteDataSource remoteDataSource;
  final UserLocalDataSource localDataSource;

  UserRepositoryImpl({
    required this.remoteDataSource,
    required this.localDataSource,
  });

  @override
  Future<UserModel> getUser() async {
    final localUser = await localDataSource.getUser(1);
    if (localUser != null) {
      return localUser;
    }
    final remoteUser = await remoteDataSource.getUser();
    await localDataSource.saveUser(remoteUser);
    return remoteUser;
  }
}
